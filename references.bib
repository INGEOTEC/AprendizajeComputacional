abstract = {Recently, sentiment analysis has received a lot of attention due to the interest in mining opinions of social media users. Sentiment analysis consists in determining the polarity of a given text, i.e., its degree of positiveness or negativeness. Traditionally, Sentiment Analysis algorithms have been tailored to a specific language given the complexity of having a number of lexical variations and errors introduced by the people generating content. In this contribution, our aim is to provide a simple to implement and easy to use multilingual framework, that can serve as a baseline for sentiment analysis contests, and as a starting point to build new sentiment analysis systems. We compare our approach in eight different languages, three of them correspond to important international contests, namely, SemEval (English), TASS (Spanish), and SENTIPOLC (Italian). Within the competitions, our approach reaches from medium to high positions in the rankings; whereas in the remaining languages our approach outperforms the reported results.},

@book{Wasserman2004,
   abstract = {This book is for people who want to learn probability and statistics quickly. It brings together many of the main ideas in modern statistics in one place. The book is suitable for students and researchers in statistics, computer science, data mining and machine learning. This book covers a much wider range of topics than a typical introductory text on mathematical statistics. It includes modern topics like nonparametric curve estimation, bootstrapping and classification, topics that are usually relegated to follow-up courses. The reader is assumed to know calculus and a little linear algebra. No previous knowledge of probability and statistics is required. The text can be used at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level.},

@article{Quinlan1986,
   abstract = {The technology for building knowledge-based systems by inductive inference from examples has been demonstrated successfully in several practical applications. This paper summarizes an approach to synthesizing decision trees that has been used in a variety of systems, and it describes one such system, ID3, in detail. Results from recent studies show ways in which the methodology can be modified to deal with information that is noisy and/or incomplete. A reported shortcoming of the basic algorithm is discussed and two means of overcoming it are compared. The paper concludes with illustrations of current research directions.},

abstract = {We address the general problem of finding suitable evaluation measures for classification systems. To this end, we adopt an axiomatic approach, i.e., we discuss a number of properties ("axioms") that an evaluation measure for classification should arguably satisfy. We start our analysis by addressing binary classification. We show that F1, nowadays considered a standard measure for the evaluation of binary classification systems, does not comply with a number of them, and should thus be considered unsatisfactory. We go on to discuss an alternative, simple evaluation measure for binary classification, that we call K, and show that it instead satisfies all the previously proposed axioms. We thus argue that researchers and practitioners should replace F1 with K in their everyday binary classification practice. We carry on our analysis by showing that K can be smoothly extended to deal with single-label multi-class classification, cost-sensitive classification, and ordinal classification.},
